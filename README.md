# TODO#

 - Mobile version
 - CannonJS Trimesh colliders are awesome and super easy to use. However, for collisions with high speed, basic shapes works better. I have to add some basic-collider to certain areas where the ball sometimes gets stuck.
 - Create an Audiomanager to manage all audio files and their playback.
 - Improve the bounce of the ball with flippers when they move, still not very natural.
 - Most of the materials are MeshStandardMaterial, in some cases other materials with better performance can be used.
